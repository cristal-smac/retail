# tools for multiagent retail simulations

This repository contains a simulator used to show multiple contextual effects like decoy effet also called attraction effect. In this model, our simulations operate on a category of products that are in direct competition. Rather than directly simulating sales, we simulate the population of agents and their buying behavior at a given moment. Thus, the "choices" of agents do not affect their future purchases; their purchases are not recurrent.

### Get started

"_GetStarted_Decoy_effect_" notebook is a presentation of the model, all the posible methods and how to use it. This notebook is made to understand parameters of the model and agents and how to use those parameters properly. You can launch this notebook directly with the following link :
